## Inspiration

Natural disasters are sudden events such as floods, earthquakes, or hurricanes that cause humongous damage to both human lives and earth's resources. Though they can't be prevented, with meticulous planning and sagacious implementation they can be mitigated. Nutural Disasters are the time of chaos and panic where a small idea when implemented at the right time with the right means can aid humanity to a profuse extent.
